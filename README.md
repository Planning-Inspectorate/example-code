# Example Code

Code examples and snippets to complement learning materials. Code is organised with a folder per topic, and each example in a separate file or folder.

To get started, run `npm ci` to install dependencies. Then run a given example with Node, e.g.

```shell
node nunjucks/01-overview-a.js
```

_Note, examples use ES6 module imports. They also don't always comply with our coding standards (for brevity)._
