# Prisma example code

To run a local database to use with Prisma, there is a docker-compose file included in this directory.
To run the database, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start the database running in the background. It is configured to run on port 1434 so it should not interfere with other databases you may have running on your machine.
